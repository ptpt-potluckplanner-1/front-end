## Testing
+ cd into /potluck-planner
+ npm run test
+ To add a render test for a new component, use the code snippet "`test`" (assuming you're using VSCode) in the component.test.js file, you will only need to type the component name in *DoubleCamelCase*, then *singleCamelCase* ``` test [tab] Component [tab] component ``` and you've written a test.
This assumes that your file structure keeps the components in ```/components``` and the tests in `/tests`
* use the snippet "`testid`" to add ```data-testid="component"``` to the component's topmost element and replace `"component"` with the name of the component you are testing, this will be the name 'test' looks for.
* now you can write a simple test in about 2 seconds, yay snippets!
